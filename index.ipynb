    "## SQL Interview Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "This quiz contains questions on topics you can expect to see in an interview pertaining to SQL and Relational Databases. Some of them are multiple choice, while some are short answer. For these short answer questions, double click on the Jupyter Notebook and type your answer below the line. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "what are the 4 main datatypes in SQLite3? Can we use other common types from other kinds of SQL?\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "text, integer, real, blob______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the relationship between **Primary Keys** and **Foreign Keys**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "__Primary keys uniquely identify rows within a table.  Foreign keys are the primary keys of other tables.  They can be used to join between the tables._____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the different types of relationships entities can have in a SQL database. \n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "__One-to-one: one row matches to one row in the other table.\n",
    "One-to-many: One row matches to many rows in another table (for instance a Customer matching to the customer's orders in another table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many-to-many : one or more rows matching to one or more rows in another table.\n",
    "_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the various types of JOINs possible with SQL. \n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_JOIN (inner join): keeps matches from both tables.\n",
    "Left (or right) Join - keeps all from left and matches from right.\n",
    "Outer Join - keeps all from both, regardless of whether they matched._\n",
    "Left Anti-Join - keeps any from left that are not matched in right\n",
    "Anti-Union - keep all from left and right except those in both._____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 5\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the relationship between Aggregate functions and GROUP BY statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_Aggregate functions are calculations performed on fields after, generally after reflecting a GROUP BY statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "The GROUP BY statement makes groups based on a condition, upon which aggregations can be applied, or ?HAVING conditions can be used as filters.______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 6\n",
    "\n",
    "What role do Associative Entities play (JOIN Tables) in many-to-many JOINs?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_Associative entities help bridge many to many joins.  They create a bridge of foreign keys that aren't connected between two tables.______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we practiced answering open-ended interview questions for SQL and Relational Databases. "
